# Config used for Windows OS.
#
# NB: On Windows 10:
# - left/right/bottom decorations are still there
#   (can drag them for resize, and programmatically appear in bounds values),
#   but are fully transparent, and title bar and ico/max/close buttons drawings
#   covers both the area for window drag and the top border (for resize)
#   (which makes top border resizing impractical if window span is too small).
# - Decoration widths are different. Easy to determine them experimentally by using
#   HostCoordsRegularBwdTestCase and comparing JavaFX binding (which use these values)
#   to AWT/Swing, selecting both bindings with "superimposed" pressed:
#   displayed client/windows bounds values and window/client location on screen
#   should match exactly.

# TODO algr On Windows, Allegro5 is special.
# The "display" surface that we call client area or just client for simplicity,
# is not at (0,0) in actual (visible) client area, but at (1,1), but that
# might just be a visual illusion due to borders not being painted properly.
# Seems we need the same rework offset whatever the Windows version:
