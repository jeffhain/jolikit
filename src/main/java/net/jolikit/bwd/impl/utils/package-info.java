/**
 * Root package for utilities that make it easier to implement bindings.
 * 
 * OpenGL:
 * One of the most difficult things to deal with when doing a binding,
 * other than backing libraries complicated APIs, unreliable/inconsistent
 * behaviors and glitches, is to learn how to use OpenGL if the backing library
 * is based on it, and in particular to find good tutorials (there are a lot
 * of bad and/or obsolete ones).
 * Some useful links in this case:
 * - http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Table-of-Contents.html
 * - https://solarianprogrammer.com/2013/05/10/opengl-101-windows-osx-linux-getting-started
 * - http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/courses/eecs487/common/notes/APITables.xml
 * - https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Common_Mistakes
 * Also, looking at bindings already done on top of OpenGL should help much.
