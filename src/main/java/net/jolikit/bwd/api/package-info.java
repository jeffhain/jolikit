/**
 * Root package of BWD.
 * 
 * BWD is a simple 2D UI API to abstract away UI libraries
 * (UI thread scheduling, windowing and related events, graphics (drawing
 * primitives, text, images, rectangular clipping, translations and 90 degrees
 * rotations), fonts, cursors, and devices (mouse, wheel and keyboard) events).
 * It's meant to serve as a basis for creating either simple 2D UIs directly,
 * or toolkits on top of which UIs can be built.
 * 
 * InterfaceBwdBinding is the entry point of the API.
